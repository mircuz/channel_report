Abstract = {{On June 26, 2007, IBM announced the Blue Gene/P (TM) system as the
   leading offering in its massively parallel Blue Geneo supercomputer
   line, succeeding the Blue Gene/L (TM) system. The Blue Gene/P system is
   designed to scale to at least 262,144 quad-processor nodes, with a peak
   performance of 3.56 petaflops. More significantly, the Blue Gene/P
   system enables this unprecedented scaling via architectural and design
   choices that maximize performance per watt, performance per square foot,
   and mean time between failures. This paper describes our vision of this
   petascale system, that is, a system capable of delivering more than a
   quadrillion (10(15)) floating-point operations per second. We also
   provide an overview of the system architecture, packaging, system
   software, and initial benchmark results.}},

abstract = {A direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations is used to compute the space–time correlations of velocity fluctuations in a turbulent channel flow. By examining the autocorrelation R(ξ,τ) of the longitudinal wall shear-stress as a function of the streamwise and temporal separations, the effects of the limited extent of the computational domain when (artificial) periodic boundary conditions are used can be described and quantified. A time scale similar to the conventional integral scale but statistically related to the life time of the turbulent structures is computed from spatio-temporal data. The convection velocity, defined as the direction in the ξ,τ plane where the autocorrelations have their maximum at vanishingly small time delay, is computed as a function of the distance from the wall, and compared with the data available in the literature. Based on autocorrelations, the accuracy within which Taylor’s hypothesis is verified is quantitatively assessed. Last, the effect of the spatial discretization on the statistical characterization of wall turbulence is discussed.},

abstract = "This paper presents a family of finite difference schemes for the first and second derivatives of smooth functions. The schemes are Hermitian and symmetric and may be considered a more general version of the standard compact (Padé) schemes discussed by Lele. They are different from the standard Padé schemes, in that the first and second derivatives are evaluated simultaneously. For the same stencil width, the proposed schemes are two orders higher in accuracy, and have significantly better spectral representation. Eigenvalue analysis, and numerical solutions of the one-dimensional advection equation are used to demonstrate the numerical stability of the schemes. The computational cost of computing both derivatives is assessed and shown to be essentially the same as the standard Padé schemes. The proposed schemes appear to be attractive alternatives to the standard Padé schemes for computations of the Navier–Stokes equations."

abstract = {This book has eight chapters. I will go through them sequentially, pointing out the main themes, the useful and original parts, and also the weaker points that I have noticed. Chapter 1 describes the occurrence of turbulence in laboratory experiments. It contains many nice illustrations. This would be a perfect introduction to a difficult subject if the Reynolds numbers, which permit one to observe flow changes, were given in the legends. The reading should therefore be complemented by An Album of Fluid Motion (1982 M Van Dyke, Parabolic Press). It is also surprising that the non-linear effects of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are essential for turbulence dynamics, are treated as 'Miscellany' (very end of chapter 1). Finally, a line distinction is unfortunately missing between the turbulent and the laminar regimes in figure 1.5(b). Chapter 2 is a presentation of the statistical tools used for completely developed turbulent fields along with a summary of probability distributions for one or two variables. Essential factors are introduced, such as turbulence intensities, skewness and flatness factors. The theory is well explained, but no single real example or value is given. Also, a clear table of the joint probability distribution would have been useful, and would explain the notion of marginal probabilities for which special thought is required from the reader (p 36). Chapter 3 discusses the spatial and temporal scales of turbulence. For the spatial scales, very useful definitions are given. For example, figure 3.2 clearly shows the relative order of magnitude of the integral length scale, the Taylor length scale and the Kolmogorov length scale. For the time scales, however, no sketch is provided, although the topic is even more complex, with several types of Eulerian correlation, and also Lagrangian scales. Moreover, only one very old reference is offered on the subject (p 72). The reader should therefore consult the vast literature which has appeared on the subject (e.g. A Favre 1965 Review on space-time correlations in turbulent fluids J. Appl. Mech. 32 241; G Comte-Bellot and S Corrsin 1971 Simple Eulerian time correlation of full- and narrow-band velocity signals in grid generated isotropic turbulence J. Fluid Mech. 48 273; P K Yeung and S B Pope 1989 Lagrangian statistics from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence J. Fluid Mech. 207 531). Chapter 4 is a classic presentation of the general averaged equations which govern turbulence quantities. The turbulent viscosity coefficient is presented in detail, with its advantages and shortcomings. The most celebrated example of a prohibited use, the wall jet, is presented in figure 4.1. However, figure 4.1 shows the profile of instead of that of the total shear = µ 1 / x 2 - . As a consequence, the viscous stress which exists at the wall cannot be recovered, and in the outer part of the jet, where a Boussinesq turbulent viscosity coefficient is acceptable, the result is off by a sign. The reader will benefit from referring to the original paper by J Mathieu (1969 Ecoulements pariétaux J Mécanique 8 97). Later on, in figure 4.4, the turbulent kinetic energy budget is unfortunately presented upside-down. This was standard in very early work, but currently there is a consensus for placing gains upwards and losses downwards, as pioneered in the book by Tennekes and Lumley referenced by the authors. Chapter 4 ends with homogeneous turbulence subjected to a uniform shear, and to the action of two successive plane strains. This part is treated with great care, and good experimental support is provided. The same is true for the section involving rotation effects, where several useful equations are derived. Chapter 5 is the largest chapter of the book (one hundred pages). It deals with jets, wakes and boundary layers. The unity comes from the boundary-layer approximation which is presented with scrutiny, after lengthy consideration concerning laminar boundary layers. However, for turbulent jets considered in subsection 5.3, a misprint exists when the self-similarity of the streamwise velocity profile is introduced. Expression (5.50), 1 = ( x 1 - x 0 ) -1/2) f () , is obviously not dimensionally correct. As a consequence, it will be difficult to compare results concerning f () with those classically available in the literature. In the kinetic-energy budget given in figure 5.8, in addition to the reverse signs already used in figure 4.4, there is an additional confusing sentence: 'Note that the sign of the production term has been switched here to make the contributions shown sum up to zero'. The same remark applies to figure 5.15 which deals with a flat plate boundary layer. For the wakes, subsection 5.4, many of the considerations are inspired from Batchelor (1967 Fluid Dynamics Cambridge University Press), and are very valuable. Figure 5.9 should, however, provide a complete sketch of the streamlines ahead of the obstacle, and an arrow on the body to indicate its motion. Also, one does not see very clearly whether the wake is laminar or turbulent. Turbulent boundary layers, considered in subsection 5.5, are analysed with great care. The presentation also includes wall curvature effects and the presence of external pressure gradients, which are rarely covered. The log law, however, remains hastily treated so that a young engineer will find some difficulty. Throughout this chapter, physical values are parsimoniously provided, which does not ease the practical applications. Chapter 6 is devoted to spectral analysis. It is rather extensive, the Fourier analysis being applied to the instantaneous velocity fields, two-point correlations, and triple-point correlations. This part is most useful for someone who intends to work on spectral closures, such as EDQNM or DIA. Isotropy is also considered with its numerous and very useful simplifications. The reader must, however, be aware that the separation vector r is denoted x - x ' , not x '- x as usual, after the reference book by Batchelor, Theory of Homogeneous turbulence (1953, reprinted in 1999). Any quick comparison with existing work will therefore be difficult, especially when working on triple correlations, as changes of r into - r also affect the correlation indices. The final part of chapter 6 deals with experimental results. The power exponents for the time evolution of u ' and L , expressions (6.173) and (6.174), are said to be of 'no really fundamental significance', which is misleading, as they allow the turbulent Reynolds number to decrease during decay as it should (which is actually recognized by expression (6.177)). The essence of chapter 7 is devoted to the spectacular advances by Kolmogorov and co-workers. In the first part, there is the classic approach giving the spectral law E ( k )~ k -5/3 and hence E 1 ( k 1 )~ k 1 -5/3 . Figures 7.3 and 7.4 are intended to be clear illustrations for E 1 ( k 1 ) , but two remarks can be made: (i) the Reynolds numbers Re which is the key parameter for the onset of an inertial range is not indicated - although the authors try to predict it on p 297; and (ii) the use of k instead of k 1 is misleading, as these figures deal with one of the one-dimensional spectra which can be defined. In the second part, the modified Kolmogorov approach, which involves an intermittency factor for small-scale structures, is extensively treated. Noneless, this advanced topic is long and complex, should be reserved for advanced readers. Some additional aspects are also considered in chapter 7 at the other extreme: the very large-scale structures, such as the spectral form of E ( k ) when k 0 and the power law relationships for u ' 2 and L during decay. However, the simple experimental fact that the Taylor scale varies with a different power law than the integral length scale L , mentioned on p 277, is not pointed out, so to clearly conclude that a global turbulence self-similarity at all scales is impossible. Finally, the very elegant Pao closure is omitted - there are only two lines on pages 294 and 298, with no explicit reference, so I would advise the reader to read Y H Pao (1965 Structure of turbulent velocity and scalar fields at large wavenumbers Phys. Fluids 8 1063). Chapter 8 is a brief overview of the three main types of method for numerical simulation: DNS, LES and k - . Very often the archetype of homogeneous turbulent fields is considered for illustration, which constitutes a very restrictive class of flows. The DNS is presented as a valuable tool for carrying out experiments that are impossible to realize in the laboratory. This is a good statement, and an illustration would have been welcomed. The reader is therefore advised to use, for example, the Web site indicated by R D Moser, J Kim and N N Mansour (1999 Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow up to Re = 590 Phys. Fluids 11 943). For LES applied to usual flows, the subtle interaction between numerical discretization effects and subgrid models is rationally presented, but a strong personal effort remains to be made by anyone who wants to sit in front of a real, powerful computer to make numerical predictions satisfying industrial demand. Finally, for the k - technique, an original deliberate light presentation has been developed to avoid a detailed balance. This book will definitely help those who already know the subject and who are interested by theoretical approaches, with a strong preference for the Fourier space. Young students and engineers will have a hard time progressing, as illustrative sketches, experimental values and simple physical reasonings are sparingly offered.},
