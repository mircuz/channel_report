\section{$Re_{\tau}=2000$ simulation} 
The last simulation performed is carried out at $Re_{\tau}\approx2000$, which in terms of channel width and bulk velocity is approximately equivalent to $Re_{b}=100000$.\par
The bulk velocity is 24.3, $\alpha_{0}$ is 0.5 and $\beta_{0}$ is equal to 1.\par
The timestep is variable, once again determined by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition set to 1, and the simulation time is T=0.01. \par
The excessive resource requests lead us to perform a reduced simulation, able just to highlight some of the main features of this $Re_{\tau}$, since the flow is still sensible to the initial conditions. Despite such reduced simulation time, in order to guarantee as better as possible results, we sampled the field every 0.001 steps, so that we can employ a 1000 fields to do the ensemble average.\\~\par
The grid employed in this simulation face 1000 points in the wall-normal direction, 4096 in the spanwise direction and 4096 points along the streamwise dimension. The mesh size is extremely huge, with more than 8 billions of points.\par
We reported a summary of the simulation configuration in table~\ref{table:2000}\\~\par

The disk space requirement raised approximately by a factor of 10, with 400GB of disk space needed per each field. This reason pushed us once again to rely in live post processing, instead of saving snapshots of the field.\\~\par

The statistics gained from the simulation are here presented.\par
We start from figure~\ref{loglaw:2000}, which report the law of the wall. Despite the graph is not perfect, during the simulation the data has shown a progressive tendency to re-align with the theoretical behavior, characterized by $k=0.41$ and $B=5.2$. As consequence, towards the centerline, the velocity defect law is affected by fluctuations caused by the poor temporal resolution, as shown by the graph~\ref{velocity:defect:2000}. Despite these fluctuations, it is possible to see that the region subject to linearity has become wider with respect to previous simulations. \\~\par

The errors present in the mean flow tend to amplify their magnitude when dealing with the fluctuating terms.\par
Despite of this the region of main interest, which is limited to few wall-units, seems to be not influenced by such the errors.  \par
By looking at the \emph{rms} profiles sketched in figure~\ref{budget:2000}, we can clearly see that the wall-normal fluctuating term remains approximately zeros until we reach $t\approx10$. This means that despite the higher $Re_{\tau}$, the turbulence still exhibit itself as a bi-dimensional phenomena close to the wall, exactly what happened also for the lower Reynolds simulations.\par

Although the values presented in this figure are quantitatively wrong, figure~\ref{rms:2000} present the qualitative behavior of the \emph{rms} in a $Re_{\tau}=2000$ simulation. The raise in Reynolds number modify the fluctuations distribution with a generalized upward shift. Despite this increase the peaks coordinate tend to remain approximately constant. The knee tends to move rightward for all the \emph{rms} terms, towards the centerline. Also the outer-cycle peaks tend to exhibit an upward shift.\\~\par

The streamwise and spanwise \emph{rms} terms tends to be higher since they leave the wall, this can be caught by comparing figure~\ref{wall:rms:2000} with figure~\ref{wall:rms:1000}. As can be recovered from the plot, such curves exhibit a linear growth for a wider range of wall coordinates, with respect to previous simulations. \par
The wall-normal fluctuation develops perfectly as $y^{+2}$ and its starting value is lower than the ones in previous simulations.\\~\par


For what concern about the \emph{production} term of the turbulent kinetic energy, according to figure~\ref{tke:prod:2000}, we can see that there are no changes to the profile, with the peak which remains near $y\approx12$. \\~\par

The normalized total shear stress profile is presented in figure~\ref{stresses:2000}. The graph exhibit the typical profile, with the Reynolds stresses that grows immediately and reach their peak before $y^{+}\approx 100$. \par
The crossing point between the viscous stress and Reynolds ones is still around $y\approx12$. This will be shown in the next chapter with an higher level of detail.
