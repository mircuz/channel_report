\section{$\mathbf{Re_{\tau}=180}$ simulation}

The $Re_{\tau}=180$ simulation has been used to validate our results against the~\cite{kim_moin_moser} ones. \par
The graphs~\ref{loglaw_180} and~\ref{budget_180} show the behavior of the $\bar{u}^{+}$ and the TKE budgets in the near wall region, with $\bar{u}^{+}$ indicating the mean velocity profile, adimensionalized using friction velocity. \par
In both figures we reported the \emph{Kim et al.} results, using dotted line, for comparison. \\~\par

Our statistics have been registered using a simulation time of 50 non dimensional units, recording data every 0.1 steps.
In total 500 fields have been used to perform the ensemble average. \par

The data fitting is good, despite being perfect. The differences are related to the fluctuations present in the~\cite{kim_moin_moser} database, which, although well established, is far from being perfect. \\~\par

The results are in agreement with the typical curves behavior, in particular, by looking at the budget curves, we can distinguish the classical peaks, facing $ww^{+} \approx 1.3$ near $y^{+} \approx 35$  ... \par
The figure~\ref{loglaw_180} report the $\bar{u}^{+}$ behavior near the wall. From 0 up to 5 $y^{+}$ units we can see the typical $\bar{u}^{+}=y^{+}$ behavior, which characterize the viscous sublayer. Once $y^{+}>30$ we see the arise of the logarithmic law of the wall, characterized by the equation

\begin{equation*}
\bar{u}^{+} = \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln y^{+} +C^{+},
\end{equation*}

where the Von Karman constant $\kappa=0.41$ and $C^{+}\approx 5.0$, like smooth wall experiments evidenced.
