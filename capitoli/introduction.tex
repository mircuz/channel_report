We briefly discuss the setup of our channel flow and the equations used to solve the problem.



the engine of Quadrio and Luchini described into~\cite{cpl:presentazione} which works per \emph{y-slabs}, as shown in figure~\ref{domain_decomp},

These solutions require communication to perform the array transpose needed by the FFTs in the two homogeneous directions
