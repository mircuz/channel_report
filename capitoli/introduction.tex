\section{Problem Definition}
\pagestyle{headings}

Before moving to what has been done in this thesis I wish to briefly discuss the setup of our channel flow and the equations used to solve the problem.

We have the domain sketched in figure~\ref{sketch_dominio} where the $x$ and $z$ coordinates denote the streamwise and spanwise directions of the flow, while the $y$ coordinate is the wall normal ones.
Along these three dimension we have $u,v$ and $w$ components of velocity.

The flow is assumed to be periodic in the streamwise and spanwise directions. The lower wall is at position $y_l$ and the upper wall at position $y_u$. The reference length $\delta$ is taken to be one half of the channel height.
Once an appropriate reference velocity is chosen, we can define the Reynolds number as:
\[
Re = \frac{U\delta}{\nu}
\]
where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

According to our geometry and the assumption of incompressible flow, we can express the behavior of the flow through the mass conservation law and the Navier-Stokes equations, which in a dimensionless form states:\\
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z};
\label{mass:cons}
\end{equation}
\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:schema}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} &= 
- \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{Re} \nabla^{2}u;  \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} &= 
- \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \frac{1}{Re}\nabla^{2}v;\\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} &= 
- \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{Re}\nabla^{2}w;
\end{align}\end{subequations}

These solutions require communication to perform the array transpose needed by the FFTs in the two homogeneous directions
