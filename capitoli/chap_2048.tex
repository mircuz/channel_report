\section{Scaling Performance of $4096\times512\times256$ problem}
This is the most interesting benchmark since our code has been developed with the idea to enable the possibility to deal with very large problems.
In fact, differently from the previous simulations, this $4096\times 512 \times 256$ problem can not run in a single core environment.
On a Intel i5 of $7^{th}$ generation~\cite{intel:i5} require at least two cores, while on a Xeon Phi~\cite{intel:xeonphi} the minimum cores requirement arise to 32 units.
