\section{Scaling Performance of $4096\times512\times256$ problem}
This is the most interesting benchmark since our code has been developed with the idea to enable the possibility to deal with very large problems.
In fact this $4096\times 512 \times 256$ problem, like the previous one, can not run in a single core environment.
On a Xeon Phi~\cite{intel:xeonphi} the minimum requirement is to employ 2 processors.
\par
As the previous problem have highlighted the less cores are used the better results are scored.
For this reason in this problem we decided to take as reference the 32 cores run, avoiding to perform 64 cores simulations since we feel confident that its performances are the poorest. As proof of our reasoning we will see that the 32 cores configuration, now, will achieve the lowest performance.  \\

The figure~\ref{20481} show the time scaling of our code.
